# ping-pong

A simple and efficient project for demonstrating "ping-pong" style communication logic.  
This repository can serve as a starting point or educational resource for understanding request-response cycles, event-driven systems, or for implementing a basic ping-pong game or network utility.

## Features

- Clear separation of "ping" and "pong" logic
- Easy-to-read code, suitable for beginners or instructional use
- Lightweight and minimal dependencies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if this is a Node.js project)
- Or any relevant language/runtime required by your implementation

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alpitkumarg/ping-pong.git
cd ping-pong
npm install         # if using Node.js, otherwise adapt as needed
```

### Usage

#### Run the Example (Node.js sample)

```bash
node index.js
```

#### Or, for other environments:

- Refer to the main source file (e.g., `index.js`, `main.py`, etc.)
- Adapt the command as per the language used in the repo

## Example Output

```
Ping!
Pong!
Ping!
Pong!
```
